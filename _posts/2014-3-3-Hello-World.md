title: Welcome to my Blog !

I don't know what to write for my first post and when I don't know what to do I usually use google, sometimes I wonder if I'm really a developer or just a good Googler, difficult to answer ! Well my name is Anass, I'm 22, I love football, pizza and the great Raja Casablanca, I will post about java, web, new technologies, and stuff for bearded people, though I have no beard !

The easiest way to make your first post is to edit this one. Go into /_posts/ and update the Hello World markdown file. For more instructions head over to the [Jekyll Now repository](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now) on GitHub.
