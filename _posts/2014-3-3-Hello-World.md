title: Welcome to my blog !

I don't know what to write for my first post and when I don't know what to do I usually use google, they say that it is better to write what comes into our head ! Sometimes I wonder if I'm really a developer or just a good Googler, difficult to answer ! Well my name is Anass, I'm 22, I love football, pizza and the great Raja Casablanca, I will post about java, web, new technologies, and some stuffs for bearded people, though I have no beard !
